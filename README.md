# Project 1: Model Evaluation & Validation
## Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Boston Housing Prices project predicts the prices for houses based on features of dataset. Results are evaluated and validated using f-score and k-fold cross-validation. Project completed during Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.
### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), i pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Completed code is provided in the `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `housing.csv` dataset file to complete your work. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

HTML report is available under 'boston_housing.html'
### Data

The dataset used in this project is included with the scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)). You do not have to download it separately. You can find more information on this dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) page.
